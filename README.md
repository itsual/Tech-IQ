# 🧠 Tech-IQ: From Bytes to Boardrooms  
*Curated Tech Wisdom for Strategic Leaders*

Welcome to **Tech-IQ** — a no-jargon, executive-savvy series designed to decode complex AI/ML technologies and infrastructure for business leaders, architects, and modern decision-makers. Each edition is designed as a standalone capsule of clarity — explaining not just how the tech works.

## 🔍 Tech-IQ Series Highlights

### 🧙‍♂️ Tech IQ #1: LLMs Aren't Magic Wands!
📂 **Topic:** `Text-2-SQL-LLM-ISNT-MAGIC`  
🧠 **Insight:** Text-to-SQL with LLMs isn't plug-and-play magic. It demands schema awareness, guardrails, and validation.  
🔧 **Reality:** LLMs are autocomplete machines, not certified SQL analysts. Expect hallucinations unless you structure the context carefully.

### 🚀 Tech IQ #2: CI/CD for ML—It’s Not Just “Pushing Buttons”  
📂 **Topic:** `CI-CD`  
🧠 **Insight:** CI/CD in ML includes retraining triggers, dataset versioning, evaluation thresholds—not just Git commits.  
🔧 **Reality:** ML CI/CD pipelines look like DevOps with data and statistical checkpoints woven in.

### 🛠️ Tech IQ #3: Kubernetes, Containers & the Hidden Plumbing of AI  
📂 **Topic:** `Kubernetes Containers & More`  
🧠 **Insight:** Kubernetes is not a buzzword—it's the invisible backbone that scales AI, ensures resilience, and manages workloads.  
🔧 **Reality:** No YAML, no scale. Your model may be 99% accurate but 100% offline without orchestration.

### 🧬 Tech IQ #4: How Neural Networks Work – From Neurons to Transformers  
📂 **Topic:** `Neural Network`  
🧠 **Insight:** Neural networks mimic neurons in name, but function as sophisticated algebraic graph flows.  
🔧 **Reality:** From perceptrons to transformers, the secret lies in how information is weighted and passed—not in “intelligence.”

### ⚙️ Tech IQ #5: AI Compute & Precision — A Leader's Infrastructure Guide  
📂 **Topic:** `GPU TPU Precision etc`  
🧠 **Insight:** Precision (FP32 vs INT8) and hardware (GPU vs TPU) impact cost, speed, and model behavior.  
🔧 **Reality:** Strategic leaders must align model goals with compute constraints—not overbuy compute horsepower.

### 🤖 Tech IQ #6: Agentic AI ≠ AI Agents  
📂 **Topic:** `AI Agents Vs Agentic AI`  
🧠 **Insight:** An "agent" calls APIs. An agentic AI sets goals, reasons, adapts. Huge difference.  
🔧 **Reality:** Agentic AI combines memory, planning, context awareness. It’s not automation—it’s orchestration.

### 🛡️ Tech IQ #7: Red Teaming vs Closed UAT — LLMs Need Both  
📂 **Topic:** `UAT vs Red Teaming`  
🧠 **Insight:** Closed UAT validates use-case readiness. Red Teaming finds vulnerabilities—prompt injections, jailbreaks, and adversarial QA.  
🔧 **Reality:** UAT = “does it work?” / Red Team = “how can it break?”
